If you use this code as the basis for writing your own parsers or
drivers for the mouse, great!  If it is a significant help, I would
appreciate if you mention me or this code as a source, but I don't
require that.  I also don't imagine I would ever care about
distributors including a copyright or permission notice when
distributing compiled code -- the code is pretty simple given the
knowledge of the message formats.
