This code contains a Linux kernel driver for the magic mouse.  Please
see the INSTALL file for directions on how to use it with your kernel.

This code also contains three standalone programs:

hid-parse reads one or more input files (specified on the command
line) that contain hexadecimal-formatted HID report descriptors, and
prints out human-readable text forms of the descriptors.  It should be
considered fairly complete and stable.

mtalk talks to an Apple Magic Mouse (using L2CAP with the HID control
and interrupt Protocol and Service Multiplexors [PSMs]) and prints
human-readable forms of the messages that it receives.  Typically the
only command-line parameters you would pass are -r <BluetoothAddr>.
It should be considered 85% complete.

usb-bt-dump reads a text dump in the format generated by Linux's
usbmon (e.g. /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/0u) to parse Bluetooth
messages at various layers (HCI, L2CAP, etc) and print annotations
with the parsed form.  It is woefully incomplete and buggy and will
probably not be maintained.

I wrote usb-bt-dump first, followed by mtalk, followed by hid-parse.
mtalk is the only one that I expect to modify going forward.
