INSTALLING THE MAGICMOUSE DRIVER
--------------------------------

The Magic Mouse driver for linux is a module named hid-magicmouse.

Released kernels (at least up through 2.6.33-rc4) do not have all the
hooks that a driver needs to talk to the Magic Mouse.  These are
provided in two patch files, so you must apply them and rebuild the
kernel before you can load hid-magicmouse.  To apply them, change to
your linux-2.6 directory, and run:
  patch -p1 < .../path/to/0001-Export-hid_register_report.patch
  patch -p1 < .../path/to/0002-Add-a-hid_ll_driver.hid_set_report-function.patch

At this point you can either apply
0003-Add-a-device-driver-for-the-Apple-Magic-Mouse.patch (in the same
fasion) and build hid-magicmouse in the kernel, or you can build and
install the kernel and then build hid-magicmouse from this directory.
You will obviously need to reboot into the new kernel before the
module can be loaded, but at that point user-space should see it as a
normal input device, including a(n emulated) scroll wheel and middle
button.
