INSTALLING THE MAGICMOUSE DRIVER
--------------------------------

The Magic Mouse driver for linux is a module named hid-magicmouse.

Older kernels do not have all the hooks that a driver needs to talk to
the Magic Mouse.  These are provided in this directory; you must apply
them and rebuild the kernel before you can load hid-magicmouse.  To
apply the patch series, change to your linux-2.6 directory, and run
either:
  git apply *.patch
OR (in a Bourne shell, such as /bin/sh):
  for PATCH in *.patch ; do patch -p1 < $PATCH ; done

This series were cherry-picked from the HID and Bluetooth trees onto
v2.6.32.8.  They should be filtering from the HID and Bluetooth trees
into the mainstream kernel between v2.6.33 and v2.6.34.  This
directory's hid-magicmouse.c should match the final result of applying
the patches in sequence.

You will obviously need to reboot into the new kernel before the
module can be loaded, but at that point user-space should see it as a
normal input device, including a(n emulated) scroll wheel and middle
button.
