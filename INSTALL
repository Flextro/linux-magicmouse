INSTALLING THE MAGICMOUSE DRIVER
--------------------------------

The Magic Mouse driver for linux is a module named hid-magicmouse.

Released kernels (at least up through 2.6.33-rc4) do not have all the
hooks that a driver needs to talk to the Magic Mouse.  These are
provided in three patch files, so you must apply them and rebuild the
kernel before you can load hid-magicmouse.  To apply them, change to
your linux-2.6 directory, and run:
  patch -p1 < .../path/to/0001-Bluetooth-Keep-a-copy-of-each-HID-device-s-report-de.patch
  patch -p1 < .../path/to/0002-HID-make-raw-reports-possible-for-both-feature-and-o.patch
  patch -p1 < .../path/to/0003-Export-hid_register_report.patch

As of February 5th, the first two are in the corresponding subsystem
maintainers' trees for integration into the mainstream kernel.  If you
have new enough kernel code, you may not need to apply those patches.

At this point you can either apply
0004-Add-a-device-driver-for-the-Apple-Magic-Mouse.patch (in the same
fashion) and build hid-magicmouse in the kernel, or you can build and
install the kernel and then build hid-magicmouse from this directory.

You will obviously need to reboot into the new kernel before the
module can be loaded, but at that point user-space should see it as a
normal input device, including a(n emulated) scroll wheel and middle
button.
